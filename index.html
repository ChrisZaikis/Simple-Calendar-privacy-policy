      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Privacy Policy -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. Privacy Policy</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Data Controller</h3>
      <p>
        The data controller is the Developer. Contact details are provided in Section 14. The App is developed in the European Union and
        is intended to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other applicable data protection laws.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Information We Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Information you provide</strong>: event titles, notes, dates, times, reminders, and country/region settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account data (optional)</strong>: if you enable cloud sync, limited Google identity data (as provided via Google OAuth)
          and your cloud-synced calendar data required to synchronize across devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical data</strong>: device type, operating system version, screen size, time zone, language, and limited error/performance
          diagnostics used to improve stability and security.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect your precise GPS location, contact list, photos, or sensitive content through Simple Calendar 2026.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Local Storage and Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        The App uses local storage technologies (for example <code>localStorage</code> or similar) to store events locally (when not using
        cloud sync), remember preferences (country, theme, view), and reduce repeated prompts. The web version may use session storage for
        essential functionality and security, not for cross-site tracking.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Purposes of Processing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core calendar functionality and reminders.</li>
        <li>Provide holidays/observances based on your selected country and year.</li>
        <li>Provide weather-based planning features where enabled.</li>
        <li>Provide optional cloud synchronization when you sign in.</li>
        <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and improve stability and performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.5 Legal Bases (GDPR)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract</strong>: to provide requested features.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: to secure and improve the App in a balanced manner.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent</strong>: for optional features such as Google Sign-In and cloud sync, which you can disable by signing out and
          clearing data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.6 Storage, Retention, and Deletion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local-only mode</strong>: data remains on your device and can be deleted via “Clear All Events” or uninstall.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud sync</strong>: data is retained while your account remains active or until deletion is requested/applied in accordance
          with reasonable retention practices.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.7 Sharing and International Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        We do not sell or rent personal data. We may share data with service providers necessary to operate the App (for example authentication,
        cloud database, hosting) and when required by law. Where transfers outside the EU/EEA occur, appropriate safeguards (such as Standard
        Contractual Clauses) are used where required.
      </p>

      <h3>2.8 Security</h3>
      <p>
        We use reasonable security measures such as encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS), access controls, and regular maintenance. No system is
        guaranteed 100% secure. You are responsible for safeguarding your device and account credentials.
      </p>

      <h3>2.9 Your Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection,
        and withdrawal of consent. Contact us to exercise rights (Section 14).

      </p>

      <h3>3.6 Termination</h3>

    <!-- 4. Trade Secret Notice -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Trade Secret and Confidentiality Notice</h2>
      <p>
        The App includes proprietary know-how and non-public implementation details that may constitute <strong>Trade Secrets</strong>.
        Unauthorized acquisition, disclosure, or use of Trade Secrets is prohibited. You must not attempt to discover, extract, or disclose
        any non-public technical information, including through reverse engineering, instrumentation, debugging, interception, or any method
        designed to derive internal operation, architecture, or proprietary workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any unauthorized disclosure or use of Trade Secrets may result in immediate legal action, including injunctive relief, damages, and
        other remedies available under applicable law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. IP, Trade Dress & Enforcement -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Intellectual Property, Trade Dress, and Enforcement</h2>

      <h3>5.1 Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        The App and Materials are protected by intellectual property and unfair competition laws, including (where applicable) EU software
        and database protections. This includes the distinctive wooden icon, the visual UI design, theme system, layout structure, and the
        weather planning presentation.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 No implied rights</h3>
      <p>
        No license or right is granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Any use outside the limited license in Section 3 is prohibited.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Evidence preservation and takedown actions</h3>
      <p>
        We actively protect our rights. Where we reasonably believe infringement or imitation has occurred, we may pursue remedies including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Notice-and-takedown requests to app stores, hosting providers, repositories, and platforms.</li>
        <li>Temporary and permanent injunctive relief to stop distribution and remove infringing materials.</li>
        <li>Claims for damages, account of profits, and recovery of costs and legal fees where available.</li>
        <li>Preservation demands and evidence retention requests to prevent spoliation.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="warning">
        <strong>Explicit warning:</strong> If you are considering copying the icon, UI, weather innovation presentation, or any portion of this App,
        do not proceed. Unauthorized copying is not “inspiration”. It is infringement. We will pursue enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Copyright + DMCA-Style Procedure -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Copyright and Takedown Procedure (DMCA-Style Notice)</h2>
      <p>
        We respect intellectual property rights and expect others to do the same. If you believe that content or an application distributed by a third party
        infringes our rights in the App or Materials (including the wooden icon, screenshots, UI layouts, or documentation), we may submit formal notices
        to relevant platforms (including app stores, hosting providers, repositories, and content delivery networks) requesting removal or disabling of access.
      </p>

      <h3>6.1 Infringement reporting requirements</h3>
      <p>
        To report suspected infringement to us, send a notice including, at minimum:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your full name and contact information (email address required).</li>
        <li>Identification of the copyrighted work(s) or protected Materials you claim are being infringed.</li>
        <li>Identification of the allegedly infringing material with sufficient information to locate it (links, package name, developer name, store URL, repository URL).</li>
        <li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use is not authorized by the rights holder, its agent, or the law.</li>
        <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury where applicable, that the information provided is accurate and that you are the rights holder or authorized to act on their behalf.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 Counter-notice</h3>
      <p>
        Where permitted by the relevant platform’s rules, an alleged infringer may submit a counter-notice. We reserve the right to contest counter-notices,
        provide evidence, and pursue court orders where appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Submission of a false infringement notice or counter-notice may expose the submitter to liability under applicable law. We may cooperate with platforms
        and lawful authorities in connection with infringement investigations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Third-Party Services -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
