        Simple Calendar 2026 is designed to help you manage your time, holidays, and events
        with minimal data collection and clear privacy controls.
      </div>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Simple Calendar 2026 (“<strong>App</strong>”,
        “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) collects,
        uses, stores, and protects information when you use our mobile and web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        By installing or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree,
        please do not use the App.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
      <p>
        The data controller for Simple Calendar 2026 is the individual developer and owner
        of the App (“Developer”). If you have any questions, you can contact the Developer
        using the details at the end of this document.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App is developed in the European Union and is intended to comply with the
        General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other applicable data protection laws.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Information you provide directly</h3>
      <p>When using the App, you may provide the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Calendar events</strong> – titles, notes, dates, times, reminders,
          and any other text you enter into an event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Country and region settings</strong> – to display local holidays,
          name days, and observances.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Account information (when using cloud sync)</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose to sign in and enable cloud synchronization:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Google account information</strong> – basic profile data such as your
          Google account ID, email address, and display name, provided via Google Sign-In
          (OAuth).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud calendar data</strong> – your events and related metadata
          stored securely in our cloud database to keep your data synchronized across devices.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Automatically collected information</h3>
      <p>
        To keep the App working correctly and securely, we may process limited technical data, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device type, operating system version, and screen size.</li>
        <li>Approximate time zone and language settings.</li>
        <li>
          Basic error and performance information (for example, failed network requests or
          crash logs) to debug and improve stability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect your precise GPS location, contact list, photos,
        or other sensitive content through Simple Calendar 2026.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Local storage and cookies</h3>
      <p>
        The App uses local storage technologies (such as localStorage or similar) to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store your events locally on your device (when not using cloud sync).</li>
        <li>Remember your selected country, theme, and view settings.</li>
        <li>Remember if you have already seen in-app messages (for example, New Year celebration).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you access the web version, session cookies or local storage may be used only
        to provide essential functionality and security, not for cross-site tracking.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide core calendar functionality</strong> – create, edit, display,
          and delete your events, holidays, and reminders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud synchronization</strong> – securely store and sync your calendar
          across devices when you choose to sign in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Localization</strong> – show the correct holidays and observances for
          your selected country and year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security and fraud prevention</strong> – protect user accounts,
          prevent abuse, and ensure the integrity of our services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improvement of the App</strong> – analyze anonymized or aggregated
          technical information to fix bugs and optimize performance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data and we do not build advertising profiles based on
        your calendar content.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Legal Bases (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are located in the EU/EEA or another region with similar laws, we rely on the
        following legal bases to process your personal data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to provide the App and its core
          features that you request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to maintain and improve the App,
          protect security, and prevent abuse, in a way that respects your rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent</strong> – when you explicitly choose to sign in with Google
          or enable cloud sync and similar optional features. You may withdraw your consent
          at any time by signing out and/or clearing your data.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
      <h3>5.1 On your device</h3>
      <p>
        When using Simple Calendar 2026 without signing in, all event data is stored
        locally on your device. You can delete this data at any time by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the “Clear All Events” option inside the App, and/or</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the App from your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 In the cloud (Supabase)</h3>
      <p>
        When you sign in and enable cloud sync, your calendar data is stored in our
        cloud database (Supabase or an equivalent provider). Data is retained for as long as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your account remains active, or</li>
        <li>Until you request deletion of your cloud data, or</li>
        <li>Until we remove inactive accounts after a reasonable period of time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can request deletion of your cloud-synced events at any time by using the
        in-app “Clear All Events” option while signed in, or by contacting us directly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell or rent your personal data. We only share data in the following
        limited circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers</strong> – we use trusted third-party providers
          to host and operate our services, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Supabase – database and authentication infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Google – Google Sign-In and identity services.</li>
            <li>Vercel or similar – hosting of the website and documentation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal requirements</strong> – when required to comply with a valid
          legal request, court order, or law enforcement investigation, in accordance
          with applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business continuity</strong> – in the unlikely event of a merger,
          acquisition, or similar transaction, your data may be transferred to the
          new owner, subject to the same privacy protections.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Service providers may be located in the EU or in other countries. When data is
        transferred outside the EU/EEA, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as
        Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent mechanisms, where required by law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) between the App and our servers.</li>
        <li>Access controls to ensure that only authorized systems and services can
            access the database.</li>
        <li>Regular updates and security patches for server and client components.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure. You are responsible for keeping
        your device and your Google account credentials safe and protected.
